// api that gives all ats ids according provided radius and ats_ids



(1) Enable or disable log
(2) Location fetch Interval
(3) enable disable developer mode
(4) Setting pending intent for clicking over notification
(5) it is important to give permission and add dependencies in main app as well other library will not fetch location by itself
(6) get ATS id that will fetch just after device gets connected from server
(7) Explanation about log stash sync rate that sync data from DB according to this rate
(8) For adding a listening key (ie ats_id) to listen other target device, developer can also add other key as well rather than ats_id and can send event via test API
(9) Removing a particular listener
(10) Remove all listeners will remove all listeners from server first (one by one) the remove listeners from local preferences.
(11) add , remove and get tag
(12) listen to tag and explain logic behind this tag listener.

(14) start and end trip concept explanation

// Pending test use case
// (1) if there are lots of location stack exist in library and certainly if developers ends the trip then there could be condition generated polyline will be incorrect.
